# One-Shot Neural Ensemble Architecture Search by Diversity-Guided Search Space Shrinking
This is an official implementation for NEAS presented in CVPR 2021.


## Environment Setup

To set up the enviroment you can easily run the following command:
```buildoutcfg
git clone https://github.com/researchmm/NEAS.git
cd NEAS
conda create -n NEAS python=3.6
conda activate NEAS
sh ./install.sh
# (required) install apex to accelerate the training, a little bit faster than pytorch DistributedDataParallel
cd lib
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex.git
python ./apex/setup.py install --cpp_ext --cuda_ext
```



## Data Preparation 
You need to first download the [ImageNet-2012](http://www.image-net.org/) to the folder `./data/imagenet` and move the validation set to the subfolder `./data/imagenet/val`. To move the validation set, you cloud use the following script: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/soumith/imagenetloader.torch/master/valprep.sh>

The directory structure is the standard layout as following.
```
/path/to/imagenet/
  train/
    class1/
      img1.jpeg
    class2/
      img2.jpeg
  val/
    class1/
      img3.jpeg
    class/2
      img4.jpeg
```


## Model Zoo
For evaluation, we provide the checkpoints of our models in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1b3iXPymaCSaXdrI8kuJREvfWY0ycWQXX?usp=sharing).

After downloading the models, you can do the evaluation following the description in *Quick Start - Test*).

## Quick Start
We provide *test* code of NEAS as follows.


### Test
To test our trained models, you need to put the downloaded model in `PATH_TO_CKP` (the default path is `./CKP` in root directory.). After that you need to specify the model path in the corresponding config file by changing the `intitial-checkpoint` argument in `./configs/subnets/[SELECTED_MODEL_SIZE].yaml`.

Then, you could use the following command to test the model.
```buildoutcfg
sh ./tools/distributed_test.sh ./configs/subnets/[SELECTED_MODEL_SIZE].yaml
```
The test result will be saved in `./experiments`. You can also add `[--output OUTPUT_PATH]` in `./tools/distribution_test.sh` to specify a path for it as well.
